👋 Hey there, I'm Philip!

🚀 I'm a self-taught Front-End developer with a strong passion for design and UI/UX, and a keen eye for detail.
Proficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript (JS), React, Git, Figma, and more.

🌍 In my free time I love learning new stuff about the world. I am also a classical singer and a decent chess player.

🔍 I'm on the lookout for opportunities to bring my passion and skills to a dynamic development team. If you're in need of a developer who can turn complexities into elegant solutions, let's connect!
